### SO basically I checked at a lot of places so there are three major kind of architectures:
1. Monolithic
2. Modular Monolithic
3. Microservice

### so basically the 1 and 3 are known mostly by almost everyone but we would be using the modular monolithic structure is something which seems to be new 
### as we already decided that our thing will have 3 major modules 1. Frontend 2. Backend 3. ML soo these are basically the "modules " but these would be deployed as a single unit


### 1. Kafka as the Central Event Bus (Monolithic Characteristic)
Kafka acts as a central message broker, and most components (audio capture, ML, storage, alerting) rely on Kafka to communicate rather than each having its own dedicated API service.

This creates a tightly coupled system where failure in Kafka can disrupt the entire pipeline.

### 2. Direct ML Processing (Tightly Integrated, Not Loosely Coupled)
Your ML inference pipeline is embedded into a single process that subscribes to Kafka and directly processes audio chunks.

Instead of having separate microservices for:

Feature extraction

Speech recognition

Distress classification

Alert triggering
You have a single ML module handling all of them.

### 3. No Independent Services for Each Task
A true microservices architecture would have separate APIs or services for:

Audio Ingestion Service

Feature Extraction Service

Speech-to-Text Service

Distress Detection Service

Alert Notification Service

In your case, all these components interact within the same deployment environment rather than through distinct APIs.

### 4. Data Flow is Centralized
The entire data pipeline flows through Kafka but is processed within a single tightly integrated application.

Instead of separate microservices handling different stages, the application pulls from Kafka, processes, and stores results directly.

So Why is it "Modular Monolithic"?
Modular: Your architecture has well-defined components (Kafka, ML, Storage, Alerting).

Monolithic: These modules still operate within a single deployment unit rather than being independent services.

Potential Issues with Modular Monolith
Scalability: Harder to scale individual components. If one part fails, it can affect the whole pipeline.

Deployment Complexity: Since everything is packaged together, making changes to one part may require redeploying the whole system.

Maintenance Challenges: As your system grows, it may become harder to manage, debug, and optimize.

When to Move Towards Microservices?
If your ML workload spikes, separating the inference module into a dedicated inference service (e.g., running on a GPU instance) would be more efficient.

If real-time constraints increase, separating Feature Extraction and Speech-to-Text as separate services can improve reliability.

If multiple teams work on different aspects, having separate services allows independent deployments.
